# Beta Testing Guide - ContentType Plugin v0.1.7b1

🎉 **Welcome to the beta testing program for the new interactive ContentType plugin!**

We've completely reimplemented the ContentType plugin with a powerful new interactive UI framework that can both detect and automatically fix content type issues in your AsciiDoc files.

## 🚀 What's New in This Beta

### Interactive UI Framework

- **Auto mode**: Automatically fixes detected issues
- **Review mode**: Shows what would be changed without applying fixes
- **Interactive mode**: Prompts you to approve each fix individually
- **Guided mode**: Provides detailed explanations and recommendations

### Enhanced Detection

The plugin now detects and can fix:

- ✅ Missing content type attributes
- ✅ Empty or invalid content type values  
- ✅ Commented-out content type lines
- ✅ Deprecated content type formats
- ✅ Misplaced content type attributes

## 📦 How to Install the Beta

### Option 1: Docker (Recommended - No Setup Required)

```bash
# Pull and test the beta version
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/workspace rolfedh/asciidoc-dita-toolkit:beta --help

# Test on your AsciiDoc files
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/workspace rolfedh/asciidoc-dita-toolkit:beta \
  --plugin ContentType --mode interactive your_file.adoc
```

### Option 2: PyPI Installation

```bash
# Install the beta version
pip install asciidoc-dita-toolkit==0.1.7b1

# Verify installation
asciidoc-dita-toolkit --version
```

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Basic Testing

Test the different interaction modes on your AsciiDoc files:

```bash
# 1. Review mode - See what issues are detected (no changes made)
asciidoc-dita-toolkit --plugin ContentType --mode review your_file.adoc

# 2. Interactive mode - Approve each fix individually
asciidoc-dita-toolkit --plugin ContentType --mode interactive your_file.adoc

# 3. Auto mode - Automatically apply all recommended fixes
asciidoc-dita-toolkit --plugin ContentType --mode auto your_file.adoc

# 4. Guided mode - Get detailed explanations
asciidoc-dita-toolkit --plugin ContentType --mode guided your_file.adoc
```

### Test Scenarios
Please test these specific scenarios if possible:

#### ✅ Missing Content Type
Create a file without any content type definition:
```asciidoc
= Your Topic Title

Content goes here.
```

#### ✅ Empty Content Type
Create a file with an empty content type:
```asciidoc
:_mod-docs-content-type:
= Your Topic Title

Content goes here.
```

#### ✅ Commented Content Type
Create a file with a commented-out content type:
```asciidoc
//:_mod-docs-content-type: PROCEDURE
= Your Topic Title

Content goes here.
```

#### ✅ Misplaced Content Type
Create a file where the content type appears after the title:
```asciidoc
= Your Topic Title
:_mod-docs-content-type: PROCEDURE

Content goes here.
```

## 🐛 What to Look For

### Detection Accuracy
- Does the plugin correctly identify content type issues?
- Are there any false positives (issues reported that aren't actually problems)?
- Are there any false negatives (real issues that aren't detected)?

### Fix Quality
- Are the automatic fixes appropriate and correct?
- Do the fixes maintain proper AsciiDoc formatting?
- Are content type values set to sensible defaults?

### User Experience
- Are the interactive prompts clear and helpful?
- Is the guided mode educational and informative?
- Are error messages understandable?

### Edge Cases
- How does it handle complex file structures?
- Does it work correctly with includes, conditionals, or other advanced AsciiDoc features?
- How does it perform on very large files?
